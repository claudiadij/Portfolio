                                As a Full Stack Developer, I rebuilt the UConn PIRE Project site, 
                                and was tasked with a key role to make data available for use by both American and Ethiopian data engineers. 
                                I Communicated with Ethiopian engineers with the task to deploy a website that could overcome language barriers. 
                                I retrieved key information and crafted Wet and Dry Season forecasts by studying Ethiopiaâ€™s precipitation trends.

                                I was charged with developing and launching customized, highly responsive website solutions using advanced technologies. 
                                I led the development of the website remodel and was responsible for all forecasting content from our legacy system to the new platform. 
                                This was all done as I simultaneously worked for NSF.

                                As of August of 2021, I wanted to enhance my experience with the languages I have been using and joined the Coding Temple bootcamp, 
                                which was able to provide me with hands-on project experiences. 
                                I developed an E-Commerce website with full cart functionality an authentication and
                                created a return on investment calculator to analyze data on financial gains.
